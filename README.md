# musikal-net-school-project

A fullstack application with a backend made with Java + SpringBoot, as well as Thymeleaf for frontend. The intention of this project was to pass an exam in Frontend, but I ended up making my own backend as well just to learn some new things a long the way.

The application should start and has an SQL dump that dumps in some data needed for the API.
